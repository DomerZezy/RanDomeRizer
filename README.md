# RanDomeRizer

## Open source Electron.JS Stuff randomizer

**Before I find out how to publish releases here's an instruction how to build an .exe**

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Clone this repository
   - Open git terminal
   - Type **git clone https://github.com/DomerZezy/RanDomeRizer.git**
   - (If you opened Git Bash, ctrl + v **will not work**, use shift + insert)
3. Navigate to the newly created folder and install Node.js dependencies
   - **cd RanDomeRizer**
   - **npm i**
4. Run build command
   - **npm run package-win** (for now only the Windows version command is written in package.json, **if you know what you're doing**, you can build an app for other OS'es)
5. Voilà, done, your .exe with necessary files will be created in **release-builds** folder
